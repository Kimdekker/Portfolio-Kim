                    <section>
                        <h2>Hello, my name is<strong><br>Kim Dekker</strong></h2>
                        <p>I'm a <strong>creative developer</strong> and <strong>digital designer</strong> based in
                            Alkmaar, the Netherlands.
                            I <strong>graduated</strong> from the MediaCollege in Amsterdam in 2022, specializing in
                            <strong>Visual Design</strong> for digital media.
                            Currently pursuing a BaSc in <strong>Communication</strong> and <strong>Multimedia</strong>
                            <strong>Design</strong> at the University of Applied Sciences.
                            <br><br>
                            As a <strong>student assistant</strong>, I enjoy helping others with several tasks and dedicate my
                            free time to collaborating with clients on various projects.
                        </p>

                    <h2>About my skills</h2>
                    <section>
                        <h3>Skills I own</h3>
                        <p>I'm someone who loves diving into <strong>new things</strong>, always hungry to learn and
                            excited by different <strong>challenges</strong>.
                            When new opportunities come up, I tackle them with enthusiasm, working to overcome hurdles
                            and reach my goals efficiently.
                            <br><br>
                            I like to keep things moving forward, finding a balance between <strong>staying
                                focused</strong> and <strong>motivated</strong> on the journey to success without
                            unnecessary delays.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <p><strong>Communication</strong> is a strength of mine. I enjoy understanding things and don't
                            hesitate to ask questions when needed, which makes me an enjoyable team player.
                            <br><br>
                            As a designer and developer, my style is <strong>progressive</strong> —I strive to
                            <strong>push boundaries</strong>, whether it's in tech or design.
                            I find satisfaction in collaborating with others, creating <strong>solutions</strong> for
                            people.</p>

                        <h3>Passion</h3>
                        <p>While it might sound cliché, I genuinely love what I do—it's more than a job; it's a
                            <strong>big hobby</strong> for me.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Experimenting</strong> with new things, <strong>tinkering</strong> around, and
                            staying updated on design and tech trends keep my mind engaged.
                            What really excites me is not just making things functional but adding that "wow, that's
                            cool" factor.
                            I'm all about making stuff both <strong>impressive and effective.</strong></p>

                        <h3>Stuff I like</h3>
                        <p>Beyond my dedication to design and development, I value spending quality time with
                            <strong>friends and family</strong>.
                            Maintaining these relationships is crucial to me, so I prioritize making time for those I
                            care about.
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Traveling</strong> is a passion of mine.
                            It not only provides a breath of fresh air for my mind but also offers new insights into the
                            world we live in.
                            Exploring new places enhances my perspective and contributes to my proficiency in what I do.

                        <p>Throughout the week, I find joy in playing <strong>rugby</strong>, a sport that has been a
                            significant part of my life since my youth.
                            I've had the privilege of participating in international tournaments with the Dutch rugby
                            team.
                            While I still play at high levels, it's no longer a professional pursuit.
                            Rugby has played a pivotal role in shaping the person I am today.
                            <br><br>
                            Beyond sports, I am an avid <strong>music lover.</strong>
                            Music serves as my source of motivation and focus, whether it's punk, ska, or classic film
                            music.
                            I also have a fondness for collecting records.</p>
