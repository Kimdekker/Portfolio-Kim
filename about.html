                        <h2>Hello, my name is<strong><br>Kim Dekker</strong></h2>
                        <p>I’m a <strong>creative developer</strong> and <strong>digital designer</strong> from Alkmaar, the Netherlands. 
                            In 2022 I graduated from the MediaCollege in Amsterdam and got my <strong>degree in Visual Design</strong> with an expertise in digital media. 
                            
                            <br><br> I’ve been studying further at the University of Applied Sciences and currently doing my BaSc in <strong>Communication and Multimedia Design.</strong>
                            
                            <br><br>I also like <strong>helping</strong> students with code as a student assistant and enjoy to work with my <strong>own clients</strong> in free time.
                            </p>

                    <section>
                        <h3>Skills I own</h3>
                        <p>I would describe myself as a person that is <strong>eager</strong> to learn and has <strong>interest</strong> at everything that that gets thrown in their way.
                            <br><br> I'm not scared for <strong>challenges</strong> and always want to complete those. I'll do everything in my power to get where I want, without spending to much time waisting. I'd call it a swirl of discipline and motivation that keeps me going.
                        </p>
                    </section>

                    <section>
                        <p>I'm a good <strong>communicator</strong> as well. I'd like to know stuff and ask questions when needed, what makes me a enjoyable <strong>team-player.</strong>
                            <br><br>
                            My style would be a <strong>progressive</strong> designer/developer that tries to push the boundries if it comes to possibilities, whether I work on tech or design topics.

                            <br><br>I like working <strong>with people, for people.</strong>

                        <p>As typical as it may sounds, I truly love what I'm doing. It's all <strong>one big hobby</strong> for me. 
                            <br><br>I like trying new things out, <strong>tinkering</strong> with stuff, keeping my head buzy with <strong>new trends</strong> around design and tech.
                            <br><br>Where I get excited about, is <strong>making stuff really cool</strong> as well as making things <strong>work</strong> as they should. I don't like making stuff just work, without the "wow, that's cool" element.

                    <h2>Things I enjoy spendinng time on</h2>
                    <section>
                        <p>Outside of being dedicated to design/development, I enjoy <strong>spending time with friends and family</strong>. I believe it's important to maintain these kind of relationships, so I will make time for those people as much as I want.
                            <br><br> Going <strong>travelling</strong> is something I really love doing. It gives my mind oxygen and <strong>new insights</strong> about the world we live in. Exploring new grounds is something I believes help me being good at what I do.

                    <section>
                        <p>During the week, I enjoy playing <strong>rugby.</strong> Rugby has been my thing since I was young, playing international tournaments with the <strong>Dutch rugby team</strong> as well. I still play on high levels, but not as a professional anymore.
                        Rugby made the person that I am today.
                        <br><br>
                        Furthermore, I am a <strong>music lover</strong>. Music keeps me going, focussed, motivated and more. whether we're talking about punk, ska or classic film music. I like to own records too.
