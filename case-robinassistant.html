                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>I took on the challenge posed by Yeti Motion to enhance the <strong>accessibility</strong> of their website in a total of 3 weeks. 
                    <br><br>
                    The original website presented various accessibility issues, prompting me to craft a revamped version that not only addressed these concerns but also retained the <strong>flashy</strong> and <strong>dynamic</strong> elements of the original.</p>            
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>My part</h3>
                <p>Leveraging <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>JavaScript</strong>, I reconstructed the site with a focus on <strong>semantic code</strong>, ensuring seamless readability for screen readers, that performs as <strong>flashy</strong> as the original one does.</p>
            </section>
        </section>

        <section class="video">
            <img src="./assets/images/robinassistant_mockup.jpg"

        </section>

        <section class="two-columns">
            <section>
                <h3>A semantic approach</h3>
                <p>For the Yeti Motion website, I prioritized a semantic approach to coding. 
                    In the HTML, I carefully structured a meaningful DOM using semantic elements for improved accessibility. 
                    <br><br>
                    The CSS was designed with semantic styles, promoting clarity and easy maintenance. 
                    JavaScript components seamlessly integrated into the semantic structure, resolving accessibility issues while enhancing overall user experience. 
                    <br><br>
                    The result is a website that combines flashy design with a strong focus on accessibility and a well-organized codebase.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>How I made it accessible</h3>
                <p>To achieve this, I utilized tags such as section, article, nav, header, footer, etc., to appropriately attribute the content. In link tags, I implemented aria labels, and image labels have well-crafted alt text.
                    <br><br>

                    CSS is composed with pseudo-classes, and I minimized the use of classes/ID's, primarily employing them for styling JavaScript elements on the site.
                    <br><br>
                    accessibility is optimised by making a light mode version, for people who prefer light mode on their personal device, and so is reduced motion included.</p>

                <h3>Canvas</h3>
                <p>In the original site, a specific section featured a unique effect that could only be replicated using a canvas tag. Despite being relatively new to working with canvas, I delved into the code terminal using NPM and libraries such as Node module WebGL + OGL to attempt and recreate a hover-over text effect.
                    <br><br>
                    Although the final result differed from the original, I successfully crafted something that exceeded my prior knowledge and capabilities.

                <h3>Creating animated effects</h3>
                <p>The pages feature a substantial amount of animated content, and I employed various methods to reconstruct these animations. 
                    Clipping masks played a significant role, as demonstrated in the lightning bolt in the first section and the hoverable list navigation. 
                    <br><br>
                    In the case of the latter, I utilized the JavaScript API Intersection Observer to dynamically make it visible when entering that specific section.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3><br><br></h3>
                <p>Special effects triggered by clicks, such as those on the play button or the navigation menu, are implemented using toggle states in JavaScript. 
                    The use of :root variables and calc() functions within the CSS significantly facilitated the creation of these effects. 
                    <br><br>
                    Additionally, the application of the TranslateZ() attribute proved to be instrumental in enhancing various sections of the content, as illustrated below.</p>
