                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>Introducing Robin Assistant: innovative software for <strong>individuals</strong> with
                    <strong>special needs</strong> and their <strong>caregivers</strong>, catering to conditions like
                    autism, Down syndrome, Alzheimer's, dementia, and brain injuries.
                    <br><br>
                    Our challenge? Crafting a conceptual revamped <strong>dashboard</strong> that works for
                    <strong>healthcare</strong> providers and <strong>clients</strong>, ensuring improved user
                    experience, clarity, and <strong>efficiency</strong> in daily tasks.
                    <br><br>
                    Our brief was on refining 1 aspect of the dashboard, honing the look and feel to perfection within a
                    single sprint, in time period of 4 weeks total. We decided to focus on remaking the process of
                    adding a client into the system, because it marks the beginning of the cycle and required the most
                    significant makeover.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>My part</h3>
                <p>As part of a collaborative team of four, I assumed the role of <strong>UI/UX</strong> designer,
                    closely collaborating with the <strong>front-end developer</strong> to ensure a delightful user
                    experience within the dashboard.
                    <br><br>
                    Therefore I designed the <strong>interactions</strong> itself and worked with the Front end dev to
                    get those interactions feel <strong>smooth</strong> and <strong>enjoyable</strong> to use.
                    <br><br>
                    Simultaneously, I collaborated with the graphic designer to refine the renewed
                    <strong>branding</strong>, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive UI that aligns seamlessly with Robin
                    Assistant's message.

                <h3>Key factors in our journey to succes</h3>
                <p>To ensure the success of this project, our foremost priority was tailoring the dashboard to suit the
                    needs of the specific target audience.
                    In this case, clarity was paramount. The dashboard had to deliver a seamless, efficient experience,
                    prioritizing speed and enjoyment, while also guaranteeing functionality without any potential
                    hazards.
                    <br><br>
                    In addition to these essential requirements, our client sought an updated UI for a more modern and
                    streamlined look. Our key focus areas were ensuring ease of use, enjoyable interactions, swift
                    functionality, and a clear, functional flow throughout the dashboard.

                <h3>A clear and easy to use experience</h3>
                <p>To achieve an easy, enjoyable, functional, and clear dashboard, we applied key factors to both our
                    design system and the working product.
                    <br><br>
                    In the design system, our focus was on clarity and reliability, reflected in elements such as our
                    color palette and font selection. We infused fun into the design by integrating yellow accents with
                    blue and white, and introducing playful interactions in the branding, evident in buttons and
                    illustrations.
                    <br><br>
                    For clarity in task explanation, we used icons in blue and yellow colors, aiding the client in
                    distinguishing between task elements - the object and the objective - for step-by-step tasks.

                <h3>Interactive pleasure</h3>
                <p>In our approach, we aimed to infuse the caretakers' and clients' environment with a sense of fun and
                    playfulness. Rather than creating a mundane, commercial dashboard, we strived for a user experience
                    that brings smiles to the faces of those who are in healthcare services.
                    <br><br>
                    To achieve this, we made clients feel appreciated and valued by incorporating playful and slightly
                    goofy illustrations that represent them, evident in elements like the loading screen animation.
                    Similarly, for caretakers who interact with both clients and the dashboard, we aimed to personalize
                    the experience, making it feel more engaging and relatable.

                <h3>Building the dashboard</h3>
                <p>Ensuring responsiveness was crucial as the dashboard would be used on both iPads and desktops. This
                    required crafting different layouts for various screen types while ensuring efficiency and
                    memorability for users.
                    Collaborating closely with the front-end developer, we made choices aligned with our key factors.
                    <br><br>
                    The primary challenge was creating an interface on iPads that was as efficient as on desktops.
                    Ultimately, we succeeded in designing a layout that resonated with our vision and provided a smooth
                    user experience on both devices</p>

            <section>
                <h3>Making the expierence </h3>
                <p>Throughout the dashboard development process, the collaboration between myself and the front-end
                    developer was marked by teamwork and practical problem-solving.
                    We coordinated efforts, especially in areas like implementing interactions and ensuring
                    responsiveness.
                    <br><br>
                    I offered support by providing alternative design solutions and insights into user behavior.
                    Together, we tackled challenges such as optimizing performance and integrating animations.
                    Our collaborative approach ensured that the dashboard met both design goals and technical
                    requirements, resulting in a smooth user experience.</p>
