                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>The team faced the challenge of creating a <strong>portal</strong> that seamlessly connected various sites and their diverse URLs. The complexity lay in the fact that these sites were built using <strong>different frameworks</strong> and <strong>codebases</strong>. The solution involved developing a navigation portal that worked across all URLs, appearing as a simple navigation interface while functioning with intricate underlying mechanics.
                    <br><br>
                    My specific challenge was collaborating with a team of developers while working with <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Next.js</strong>, <strong>TypeScript</strong>, and <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong> in a professional setting for the first time.</p>

            <section>
                <h3>My part</h3>
                <p>I worked with the Q42 team to develop components in <strong>React</strong>, ensuring the final design—created by the UI designer from Morrow—was implemented. We focused on maintaining <strong>accessibility</strong> and preserving the <strong>original aesthetic</strong> from other pages. This included replicating hover effects, dropdowns, accordions, and headings, all while adapting them to a new framework.
                    <br><br>
                    I also utilized <strong>Storybook</strong> to make interactive components that could be tested and refined before integrating them into the headless CMS, <strong>Sanity.io</strong>. This approach ensured that the components were well-documented, reusable, and accessible for future development..</p>

                <h3>Framework</h3>
                <p>For this project, we used Next.js as the framework, paired with React and TypeScript. Content management was handled through Sanity.io, a headless CMS that empowered Fonds Slachtofferhulp to manage and update their own content. Tailwind CSS was chosen for its efficiency in styling.
                    <br><br>
                    This was my first professional experience using these tools, having only explored them in personal projects and initial brainstorming sprints prior to this.

                <h3>Using storybook</h3>
                <p>Storybook was instrumental in creating interactive, reusable components for the website. By focusing on these components in isolation, I could fine-tune their behavior across various states and ensure they met accessibility standards before integrating them into the broader application.
                    <br><br>
                    This methodology not only streamlined development but also fostered collaboration within the team. Each component was well-tested and easy to adapt, enabling faster iteration and reducing redundancy in the coding process.</p>

                <h3>Components</h3>
                <p>During the project, I developed a range of components, including accordions, headers, grids, and buttons. Each component was designed with multiple states in mind, such as hover, focus, and icon-only variations.
                    <br><br>
                    I also built larger components using custom hooks derived from these smaller pieces. This approach resulted in a cohesive component library, functioning much like a design system, ensuring consistency and scalability throughout the project.
