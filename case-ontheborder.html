                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>The challenge was to devise a conceptual <strong>mobile</strong> <strong>web app</strong> solution
                    that would enable international students to <strong>explore</strong> <strong>Amsterdam</strong>
                    beyond the typical tourist attractions and <strong>experience</strong> the city like a
                    <strong>local</strong>, in the course of 3 weeks.
                    <br><br>
                    My solution is an <strong>augmented reality</strong> (AR) <strong>storytelling</strong> experience
                    designed to take international students on a captivating <strong>journey</strong> through Amsterdam.
                    By harnessing AR technology, users can immerse themselves in the city's rich history and untold
                    stories, providing a unique and authentic way to explore beyond the typical tourist destinations.

                <h3>My part</h3>
                <p>As this project is an <strong>individual</strong> endeavor, I had full responsibility for every
                    aspect of its development. From <strong>ideation</strong> and <strong>conceptualization</strong> to
                    <strong>UX</strong> and <strong>UI</strong> design, as well as the actual
                    <strong>development</strong> process, I ensured that all content was <strong>authentic</strong> and
                    aligned with the project's objectives.</p>

                <h3>The concept</h3>
                <p>Incorporating augmented reality (AR) was a deliberate choice to enhance user interaction and
                    immersion within the storytelling experience. The concept revolves around empowering users to engage
                    with the story like game characters, complete with quests and side quests. Users have the freedom to
                    progress through the game at their own pace, adding a dynamic and personalized element to the
                    experience.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>How it works</h3>
                <p>As a user, you receive main story quests and side quests, each providing coordinates within
                    Amsterdam. You navigate to these coordinates, where the mission begins in AR. The experience starts
                    with a piece of lore, offering information and facts about the area. After the lore, users engage
                    with the environment using game controls, interacting with elements within the AR setting. The
                    interaction depends on the lore that area has to tell.</p>

                <h3>Interaction and game control</h3>
                <p>Each area in the conceptual prototype features a unique storyline, influencing the type of
                    interaction within the game. For instance, in the Jordaan district, users combat pests to reflect
                    the area's historical context of dirty, damp streets and poverty during the early 1900s.
                    <br><br>
                    In contrast, visiting the NDSM yard allows users to engage in a different manner. Here, users can
                    leave their own piece of street art in the AR environment, adding a personalized touch to the
                    experience.</p>

                <h3>Fitting a style</h3>
                <p>For the style of the AR storytelling experience, I drew inspiration from the international student
                    guide but had the freedom to expand upon it. Incorporating Amsterdam's city colors, I introduced red
                    as a primary element and complemented it with other hues. To evoke a playful and game-like feel, I
                    selected typography and icons with a dynamic aesthetic. The inclusion of geometric shapes unified
                    the overall style, creating a cohesive and engaging visual identity.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>The logo</h3>
                <p>After several iterations, I selected the tulip as the logo for its recognizability and cultural
                    significance to international visitors. The center of the tulip is red, subtly hinting at the
                    coordinates users need to seek without relying on a conventional location icon.
                    <br><br>
                    Choosing the tulip allows for easy adaptation if the game expands to other cities or countries. By
                    replacing the tulip with a symbol representing the new location, the design system remains
                    consistent across different regions.

                <h3>Developing</h3>
                <p>After creating a style guide, I immediately delved into development, confident in the system I had
                    established. This approach saved considerable time, given the rapid three-week timeframe. With more
                    time available, I could focus on ensuring the prototype was both understandable and enjoyable for
                    users.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3>Used languages</h3>
                <p>For the concept, I primarily utilized HTML and CSS, leveraging a plethora of animations throughout.
                    This included effects such as the GPS pulse during the coordinate phase and various interactions
                    within the missions themselves. Flexbox was instrumental in crafting the layouts, while JavaScript
                    was employed for button interactions both within the missions and on the game map.</p>
