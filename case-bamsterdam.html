                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>My task was to provide the wireframe (given by the clients UX team) for B. Amsterdam's new events website, a <strong>design finish</strong> with the existing branding <strong>guidelines.</strong> 
                    The website needed to enable visitors to easily contact B. Amsterdam to rent event spaces and obtain detailed information about specific spaces available.
                    <br><br>
                    after, the subsequent challenge was to <strong>build</strong> the website with help of a <strong>CMS</strong>. The CMS needed to be user-friendly, allowing employees of B. Amsterdam to effortlessly add and modify content while adhering strictly to the brand guidelines outlined in the brand book, which means I had to <strong>build</strong> a <strong>template system</strong>.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h3>My part</h3>
                <p>Taking on B. Amsterdam as my own <strong>first client</strong> during my <strong>internship</strong> was a significant responsibility. I was directly in contact with them, responsible for addressing any issues that arose throughout the project. Working with such a prestigious client was both challenging and immensely rewarding, providing invaluable experience and professional growth opportunities.</p>

                <h3>Giving the wireframe color</h3>
                <p>During the user interface design phase, I had a good look on the existing brandstyling, and styled the given wireframe so the B. styling is recognizable. 
                    <br><br>
                    In the styling, that consists of black and white blocky features, I had to do something that makes the special events website stand out. Users have to see that they are scrolling through the B. events page. I solved this by giving color to the different categories within B. As they really liked that idea, I went out and gave the events page an orange accent.</p>

                <h3>My spin on the brandbook</h3>
                <p>Ensuring a consistent UI was paramount to convey the authenticity of the B. Amsterdam website. However, I faced the challenge of making the events page stand out within the brand guidelines. 
                    <br><br>
                    Through some iteration a talk with the client, I decided to infuse the events page with its own distinct style. This involved adopting a slightly more creative and relaxed layout, reflecting the dynamic nature of events compared to traditional business meetings or office settings.

                <p>B. Amsterdam sought a website that could be effortlessly updated and maintained, leading us to opt for a CMS solution. After deliberation, we decided on a custom WordPress setup.

                <h3>Building the CMS</h3>
                <p>The building plan entailed my responsibility for setting up the system, constructing the pages based on my designs, and developing a custom post type for the available rental spaces. It was crucial to ensure that the client could easily create additional pages without disrupting the custom template Iv'e made for them. This way the client can go it's own way in keeping the website up to date after my work is done.</p>

                <p>Upon completing the website build, I provided comprehensive instructions on website maintenance. This included guidance on updating content, adding new rental spaces, creating new pages, and utilizing building blocks effectively. By empowering the client with these skills, I ensured they could confidently manage and expand the website in the future.</p>
